## Authentication
Please set the following environment variables. Due to the fact that this is a demo, it is assumed that there is no MFA setup for your account and your keys will allow you the necessary access to provision the infrastructure.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="anaccesskey"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="asecretkey"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-2"
```

## Tools
The only tool needed to run this is `terraform`.
